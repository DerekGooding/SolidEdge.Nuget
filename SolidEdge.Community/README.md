# SolidEdge.Nuget

Combines
[SolidEdge.Community](https://github.com/DerekGooding/SolidEdge.Community)
and
[Interop.SolidEdge](https://github.com/DerekGooding/Interop.SolidEdge)
Into a single, easy to import NugetPackage. 

This is not my original work. Please follow the fork for the original Author. I only updated it to use current frameworks. 
I use this myself so I'll be keeping it up to date with newer versions of .Net over the years.
